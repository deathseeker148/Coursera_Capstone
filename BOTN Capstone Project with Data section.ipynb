Because some of the top selling items in a Vietnamese restaurant, outside of pho, is the iced coffee and boba tea; so in a neighborhood that enjoys their coffee and ice cream, the coffee and boba tea would do quite well."

If we can determine that a neighborhood is predominately Latin, we can bring Latin flair to the pho; but if the neighborhood is predominately German, we can bring a German flair to the pho. This will allow our restaurants to stand out from every other generic pho restaurant."
